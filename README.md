My testing grounds for code I plan to eventually add as a fork in the Renoise tool, xStream.


## What will this eventually be?
As of now, once I can get this skeleton built and working, then I will create a fork in xStream 
(https://github.com/renoise/xrnx/tree/master/Tools/com.renoise.xStream.xrnx). 
I'll port this repo over to the fork I make, and complete this project over there.


## Short Term Goals
Get the skeleton working in plain Lua.
Then get it working in xStream.
Port this repo to my xStream fork (yet to be made).
Add the rest of the flesh over there. 


## For the Public:
Wow, I wasn't expecting guests! 

If you have any suggestions, I'm actually really wanting them. Two specific things I need help with: 
 - Making my screwy metatables/modules setup more elegant.
 - Adding iterators for the setters/getters for the `notes` and `delays` properties of the `ins` class.

A summary about what inspired this: 

I've made several attempts at hitting the books and finding a music software that takes advantage of algorithmic composition techniques. Renoise is my first DAW, but my first foray into xStream was discouraging. Recently, I noticed the new added documentation. Once I wrote a few cool modules, I needed my own library. I figured out how to add my own stuff to xStream, and now I'm going to make a big ol' library to streamline my module-creation process.
